# Chatbot

### A very basic implementation of a Chatbot that responds to your speech

First, you provide the speech as an input from whatever device your mic is set to right now, either default or headphones.

The speech is first converted into text form and then the Chatbot analyzes the text by learning from the "learn.xml" file and accordingly gives a response in speech form.

Refer to the xml file, where the python script learns from. Experiment with your own patterns and templates and make the Chatbot more advanced!

For example, you could assign more variables instead of just name and use the asterisk ( * ) sign to accept more statements that might deliver a similar point.

In the outputs folder, you can go through the functioning outputs to get an idea of how the ideal output looks like.

## The speech used during this implementation was as follows 

## Functioning 1

- "Hello"

- "I am John"

- "What is my name?"

- "I am feeling sad, I don't know what to do"

- "What are you?"

- "How is the weather in Delhi?"

## Functioning 2

- "Tell me a joke"

- "Tell me about Liverpool"

- "Good night"
